# Loops Challenges

## Challenge 1

In this challenge, we're giving you a script called `email_ids_challenge.py` to create email ids for your employees at your new startup media company called Ripple Media.

To get started, make a folder inside your `jtc_class_code/challenges` called `09_bootcamp_loops`, and put `email_ids_challenge.py` in there. You can use `ls` inside the folder to make sure the `email_ids_challenge.py` script is really in there!

## Challenge 2

In this challenge, we're giving you a script called `login_challenge.py` to improve the login experience for a hypothetical command line application. We have
completed some of the work for you, you just need to take it to the finish line!

Put `login_challenge.py` in `09_bootcamp_loops`. Use `ls` inside the folder to make sure the `login_challenge.py` script is really in there!

### When you're done, "Push" to Github

As the final part of your workflow for this challenge, stage your files (`git add .`), commit (_don't forget a commit message_), and push the challenge scripts you worked on to your `jtc_class_code` github repository.

- Remember to check your Github repo online at the end to make sure this worked
