In this challenge, we are providing you with a file - `restaurants_challenge.py`. You will be working on this file to play with some Python dictionaries.

### Overview of the challenge

In this challenge, you will be creating dictionaries, reading data from nested dictionaries and also perform add, update and delete operations on dictionaries, specifically revolving around restaurants.

To get started, make a folder inside your `jtc_class_code/challenges` called `08_bootcamp_dictionaries`, and put `restaurants_challenge.py` in there. You can use `ls` inside the folder to make sure the `restaurants_challenge.py` script is really in there!

### Push to Github once you are done

As the final part of your workflow for this challenge, stage your files (`git add .`), commit (_don't forget a commit message_), and push the `restaurants_challenge.py` script you worked on to your `jtc_class_code` github repository.

* Remember to check your Github repo online at the end to make sure this worked
