### Overview of the challenge

In this challenge, you will start out by installing two Python libraries:
1. Wikipedia
2. Sportsreference

Once you are able to successfully install these, you will write 2 functions to perform a basic task using each of these libraries.

To get started, make a folder inside your `jtc_class_code/challenges` called `17_bootcamp_install_libraries`, and put `install_libraries_challenge.py` in there. You can use `ls` inside the folder to make sure the `install_libraries_challenge.py` script is really in there!

### Push to Github once you are done

As the final part of your workflow for this challenge, stage your files (`git add .`), commit (_don't forget a commit message_), and push the `install_libraries_challenge.py` script you worked on to your `jtc_class_code` github repository.

* Remember to check your Github repo online at the end to make sure this worked
