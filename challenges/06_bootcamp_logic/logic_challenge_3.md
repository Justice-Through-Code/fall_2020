# Logical and Conditonal Operators - Challenge 3

There are 2 parts to this challenge:
1. Debug code snippets
2. Stock Market Calculations

In this challenge, we are providing you an incomplete script called `playing_with_stocks_challenge.py`. You will be working on this file to debug some code snippets and also perform some basic stock market calculations.

## Challenge 3.1

### Overview of the challenge

There are 5 code snippets here that throw errors or give incorrect outputs as of now. Based on the lecture, try to debug these code snippets so that the errors disappear and we have the correct output.

## Challenge 3.2

### Overview of the challenge

Imagine that you are managing money for your clients and investing it into the stock market. You are only concerned with 5 stocks - Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.

The market price of these stocks is available to you. For every client, you need to tell him (print out) the number of stocks of a particular company that can be purchased with his current savings.

The name of the client, savings of the client and the stock under consideration need to be taken as user input.

For example, one of your clients named Alex has $5000 in savings. He is interested in knowing how many Amazon shares can he buy with his current savings. You need to output the number of Amazon stocks that Alex can purchase with his savings at the current rate.


#### Challenge 3.2.1 - Creating variables
1. Create variables to store the current approximate market price of these 5 companies - Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.

### Challenge 3.2.2 - Taking user input
1. Write code to take in the name of the client as the user input.
2. Write code to get his savings as user input.
3. Write code to find out which stock does the client is interested in as user input.

### Challenge 3.2.3 - Perform user-specific calculations
1. Based on the 3 user inputs, calculate the number of stocks that can be purchased by using conditional (if-elif-else) statements.

### Challenge 3.2.4 - Output
1. Print the output in this format

```console
Alex has $5000 in savings and he can buy 50 shares of Apple at the current price of $100.
```
