# Active Learning Challenge 4

## Quick Review 

Here's what we've learned so far: 

We've learned about how to use the **command line**. Some important commands to remember are:
* pwd - show the present working directory
* cd dir_name - move to the directory dir_name
* mkdir dir_name - create a new directory named dir_name
* ls - list everything in the current directory

Next, we learned about how to use **git**. Some important git commands to remember are:
* git status - check which files are untracked, tracked but not staged, and staged
* git add - track and stage files
* git commit - log the current state of all tracked files in the repo history
* git pull - update your local repo with changes from the remote repo
* git push - update the remote repo with changes from your local repo

Then, we learned about **primitive data types**, which are the simplest forms of representing data. The four **primitive data types** are:
* integers - these represent whole numbers
* floats - these represent decimal point numbers
* booleans - these represent True/False values
* strings - these represent text values

Last, we learned about how to run python scripts. For example, to run a script named `example.py`, we would use the command:
```
$ python example.py
```

## Putting It All Together

In this challenge, you will need to: 
* pull the challenge from the class GitHub repo
* debug and comment the python script called `tip_calculator_challenge.py`
* make a new directory called `contributors` with a file called `contributors.txt` that contains your names
* commit and push your changes

### Challenge 1.1:
First, pull the new data from the class repository to retrieve the files for this challenge.


### Challenge 1.2:
Navigate to the directory `challenges` and then to the directory `04_bootcamp_strings_booleans`.

### Challenge 1.3:
Debug this section of the python script.

### Challenge 1.4:
Fix the comments in this section of the python script. 

### Challenge 1.5:
Below each comment with the format "# Q: question here", add a comment answering the question. 

### Challenge 1.6:
Debug this section of the python script. Run the script to make sure it works!

### Challenge 1.7:
Make a directory called `contributors`. Navigate into this directory and make a file called `contributors.txt`. In this file, add "Contributors: " and your names.

### Challenge 1.7:
Navigate back to the challenges directory (two levels up: contributors -> 04_bootcamp_strings_booleans -> challenges). Add, commit, and push your work!
