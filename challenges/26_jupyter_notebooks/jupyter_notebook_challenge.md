# Jupyter Notebook Challenge

The challenge for this lesson is focused on getting used to working with jupyter notebook layout and workflow!

# Part 1
* Let's start fresh as if you just opened your computer. If you have jupyter notebooks open, log out of them. Close your command line window as well.
* Now, use your command line to go into your `jtc_class_code` folder. Make a folder here called `notebook_examples`
* Use `cd` to go into the 'notebook_examples' folder, then run `jupyter notebook` from the command line to start the jupyter notebook server


# Part 2
* Make a new Python 3 notebook
* Rename this notebook 'example_1'
* In a code cell, define a function `check_odd(number)` that takes an integer as an argument, returns `True` if it is odd, and returns `False` if not. 
    * In the next code cell, test out the the function on an odd number and make sure that it returns `True`
    * In the next code cell, test out the the function on an even number and make sure that it returns `False`
* In a new code cell, give your function some bad input (the string 'hi') to crash it. See what happens when you run that cell
* Move the previous cell (where the input was 'hi') to be immediately after the one with the function definition in it, before the tests with odd/even numbers. 
* From the Kernel menu, select **Restart & Run All**. What happens? Why?
* Make a Markdown cell, and in it write a description of what happens when you are *running all cells*, but one cell throws an error. Specifically, what happens for cells after that error?

# Part 3
* Start clean again! Shut down the jupyter notebook server
* Restart the jupyter notebook server by running `jupyter notebook` from the command line inside the `notebook_examples` folder
* This time, make a new Python 3 notebook called 'hw_1_notebook'.
* In this notebook, copy your python code from your `assignment3.py` script (and the functions from`grading_functions.py` script if you made that) into the jupyter notebook. 
 * Put each numbered problem into a separate cell
 * For each problem, put the text describing the assignment for that number into a markdown cell, so that it is easy to separate the problem description from the code
 * Add a markdown header to each problem with the problem #
* Now, make sure that you can run your notebook all the way through, generating answers for each problem as you did with your original .py script
* Once your notebook is complete, try downloading it as a pdf file using File --> Download as with the html option. How does it look?
