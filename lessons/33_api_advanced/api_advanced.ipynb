    "\n",
    "Last time, we learned how to use `requests` to make web requests directly from python. This time, we'll be learning about using other APIs to make **authorized requests**. \n",
    "\n",

    "# Getting the API keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs require **access keys** so that you are logging in to use the API's resources with certain user credentials. This is so the API can give users limits to the numbers of request they can make, or give different users different access priveleges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is usually to **sign up for an API account** to get an access key. Most websites for APIs have a link for this kind of signup. You can do this for the News API [here](https://newsapi.org/register)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you go through the process, you'll see that you now have access to an **API Key**. This is usually a very long string of characters. \n",

    "## Saving the API key to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often, we want to keep API keys **private** since they correspond with our own user accounts. So, it's a good idea to put them into separate files outside of our code, rather than pasting the key directly into code we might share. \n",
    "* One efficient way is to copy the key into a file called something like `news_api_key.txt`, then read in the text from the file with python\n",
