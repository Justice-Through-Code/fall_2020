    "# 1. Lists inside dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "You've actually seen this one before in the [restaurants challenge](https://github.com/Justice-Through-Code/fall_2020/blob/master/challenges/08_bootcamp_dictionaries/restaurants_challenge_solutions.py), although we didn't talk about it too much! \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be stored as **values** inside dictionaries, and referenced using **keys** just as with ever piece of data in a dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could have a shopping cart with lists for different categories of foods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cart = {'fruits': ['mangos', 'apples', 'oranges'],\n",
    "        'vegetables': ['spinach', 'peas'],\n",
    "        'grains': ['rice'],\n",
    "        'other': ['olive oil', 'black pepper'],\n",
    "        'total': 24.76}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this example, every value in this dictionary is a list, except for `total`, which is a float. Lists that are *inside* the dictionary are still formatted as lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing lists within dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to pull out a list item within the dictionary, we reference it by the **key** the same way we'd do it for an item that was a primitive data type. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "veggies = cart['vegetables']\n",
    "print(veggies)\n",
    "print(type(veggies))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we pull the value for `veggies`, save it to a variable, then print and inspect the type, we can see that it is a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "['spinach', 'peas']\n",
    "<class 'list'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding to the list\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to add another vegetable to our cart here. We can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cart['vegetables'].append('bell pepper')\n",
    "print(cart)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we add 'bell pepper' to the `vegetables` value list in our cart using `append()`, then print out the whole cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "{'fruits': ['mangos', 'apples', 'oranges'], 'vegetables': ['spinach', 'peas', 'bell pepper'], 'grains': ['rice'], 'other': ['olive oil', 'black pepper'], 'total': 24.76}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can see that 'bell pepper' has been added to the `vegetables` list in our grocery cart\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific list indices from a list nested in a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! But what if we wanted just a *specific* element from this list inside the dictionary? We could add further bracket indexing to do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we wanted to get the first item in `fruits` inside our cart\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(cart['fruits'][0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This gives us: \n",
    "```console\n",
    "mangos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This second set of hard brackets might be confusing, but let's break it down:\n",
    "* `cart['fruits']` is a list\n",
    "* Since `cart['fruits']` is a list, we can then do  `cart['fruits'][0]` to get the first element of said list\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also update the item in the same way by **reassigning** this variable -- we put this on the left and save in the item we want\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cart['fruits'][0] = 'papayas'\n",
    "print(cart['fruits'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see that `mango` has been replaced by `papayas`\n",
    "\n",
