    "\n",
    "* Documentation is basically a formal way for a python library to provide a 'users guide'\n",
    "* Documentation usually shows how code works, especially\n",
    "    * Available functions, their arguments, and what they return\n",
    "    * Available classes and their attributes\n",
    "    * Example use cases of functions/classes\n",
    "* Almost every python library has documentation of some form on the web, including [base python itself](https://docs.python.org/3/)\n",
    "* Documentation for some libraries is much better than others \n",
    "    * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) has very good documentation!\n",

    "\n",
    "Often, if a library has good documentation (like Pandas), the documentation is the first place to go if:\n",
    "* You're stuck trying to get a function to work\n",
    "* You want to be able to do a certain thing and you think the library might have a function that can do it\n",
    "    * For example, if there's something you want to do with a Pandas DataFrame object, the Pandas docs are a great place to start"
